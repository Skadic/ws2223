\section{Tsiligiridis' Algorithms}
\label{sec:03:tsiligiridis}

One of the earliest solution approaches for the OP is due to \citeauthor{tsiligiridis_heuristic_1984} in his 1984 paper on the topic. \cite{tsiligiridis_heuristic_1984}
He introduced two algorithms which generate a path and an algorithm that tries to improve an already existing path.

Only one of the two path-generating algorithms presented by \citeauthor{tsiligiridis_heuristic_1984} will be introduced here:
We will present the \emph{S-Algorithm} (see \cref{subsec:03:salgo}), since the \emph{D-Algorithm} requires a division of the plane into sections, which seems to have no trivial generalization to non-Euclidean inputs.
The route-improving \emph{R-I-Algorithm} will also be introduced. (see \cref{subsec:03:rialgo})
In his original paper, the input is assumed to be Euclidean. 
We will discuss whether these algorithms can work on non-Euclidean inputs.
