\section{Szwarc-Boryczka Algorithm}
\label{sec:04:szwarc}

A recent algorithm to solve the \op is due to \citeauthor{szwarc_novel_2022} \cite{szwarc_novel_2022} based on the harmony search optimization technique, 
first presented by \citeauthor{geem_optimal_2000} in his dissertation using it for the design of water distribution networks. \cite{geem_optimal_2000}
We will first describe the general harmony search method and then describe its application to the \op as described by \citeauthor{szwarc_novel_2022}.
