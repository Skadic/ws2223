\section{Conclusion}

In conclusion, we have seen that the majority of the literature concerns itself with Euclidean input,
and we set out to try and generalize existing approaches by \citeauthor{tsiligiridis_heuristic_1984} and \citeauthor{szwarc_novel_2022} to less restrictive inputs. 

While some solution approaches seem to have a fairly straightforward generalization to graphs that satisfy the triangle equation (see \cref{subsec:03:salgo}),
some require the removal of some of their heuristics (see \cref{subsec:04:algo}),
and some do not seem to be trivially generalizable like this (see \cref{subsec:03:dalgo}).
Others do not make any allusions to requirements on the input, and as such seem to work on any input without impairment compared to Euclidean inputs (see \cref{subsec:03:rialgo}).

Of course this varies for each algorithm and there are might be algorithms which can be modified to work with more general inputs without sacrificing much of there solution quality. 
However, all such generalizations must be evaluated empirically, before any conclusive statement about them can be made.
