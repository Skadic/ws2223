\section{Conclusion}

In conclusion, we have seen that the majority of the literature concerns itself with Euclidean input,
and we set out to try and generalize existing approaches by \citeauthor{tsiligiridis_heuristic_1984} and \citeauthor{szwarc_novel_2022} to less restrictive inputs. 

While some solution approaches seem to have a fairly straightforward generalization to graphs that satisfy the triangle equation (see \cref{subsec:03:salgo}),
some required the removal of some of its heuristics (see \cref{subsec:04:algo}),
and others did not seem to be trivially generalizable like this (see \cref{subsec:03:dalgo}).
Then others did not make any allusions to requirements on the input, and as such seem to work on any input without impairment compared to Euclidean inputs (see \cref{subsec:03:rialgo}).

However, all such generalizations must be evaluated empirically, before any conclusive statement about them can be made.
