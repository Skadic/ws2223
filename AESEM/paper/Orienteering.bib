	abstract = {A general description of the sport of orienteering in its two forms known as orienteering event and score orienteering event is given. The similarities between the latter and the generalized travelling salesman problem are underlined, and a common mathematical model is deduced. A 'good', if not 'optimal' solution of the corresponding problem by means of an efficient and computationally feasible method is derived and discussed. This solution is obtained by the use of either of two algorithms based on approximate methods. The two algorithms are given, and their efficiency is tested on a number of illustrative problems. Finally, a comparison between the two forms of the sport of orienteering is made.},

In the orienteering problem, a set of vertices is given, each with a score. The goal is to determine a path, limited in length, that visits some vertices and maximises the sum of the collected scores. In this paper, the literature about the orienteering problem and its applications is reviewed. The {OP} is formally described and many relevant variants are presented. All published exact solution approaches and (meta) heuristics are discussed and compared. Interesting open research questions concerning the {OP} conclude this paper.},

The {OP} is a routing problem in which the goal is to determine a subset of nodes to visit, and in which order, so that the total collected score is maximized and a given time budget is not exceeded. A number of typical variants has been studied, such as the Team {OP}, the (Team) {OP} with Time Windows and the Time Dependent {OP}. Recently, a number of new variants of the {OP} was introduced, such as the Stochastic {OP}, the Generalized {OP}, the Arc {OP}, the Multi-agent {OP}, the Clustered {OP} and others. This paper focuses on a comprehensive and thorough survey of recent variants of the {OP}, including the proposed solution approaches. Moreover, the {OP} has been used as a model in many different practical applications. The most recent applications of the {OP}, such as the Tourist Trip Design Problem and the mobile-crowdsourcing problem are discussed. Finally, we also present some promising topics for future research.},

route under the total distance limit while satisfying multiple goals. Example area of the {GOP} is eastern part of China. The

	abstract = {{AbstractThis} article studies the Hazardous Orienteering Problem ({HOP}), a variant of the more famous Orienteering Problem ({OP}). In the {OP}, a vehicle earns a profit for each customer it visits (e.g., to pick up a parcel) subject to an upper bound on the tour time. In the {HOP}, the parcels picked up at some customers have a probability of triggering a catastrophic event. The probability depends on how long the parcels travel on the vehicle. If any catastrophic event triggers, the entire collected profit is lost. The goal is to determine the tour that maximizes the expected profit. The problem has interesting applications in routing of hazardous material, cash-in-transit, and law enforcement. We propose a mixed-integer nonlinear formulation and techniques both to obtain dual bounds and to produce primal solutions. Computational tests investigate the efficacy of the methods proposed and allow to gain insights into solution features.},
