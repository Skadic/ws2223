The similarities between the latter and the generalized travelling salesman problem are underlined, and a common mathematical model is deduced. A 'good', if not 'optimal' solution of the corresponding problem by means of an efficient and computationally feasible method is derived and discussed. This solution is obtained by the use of either of two algorithms based on approximate methods. The two algorithms are given, and their efficiency is tested on a number of illustrative problems. Finally, a comparison between the two forms of the sport of orienteering is made.},

The {OP} is a routing problem in which the goal is to determine a subset of nodes to visit, and in which order, so that the total collected score is maximized and a given time budget is not exceeded. A number of typical variants has been studied, such as the Team {OP}, the (Team) {OP} with Time Windows and the Time Dependent {OP}. Recently, a number of new variants of the {OP} was introduced, such as the Stochastic {OP}, the Generalized {OP}, the Arc {OP}, the Multi-agent {OP}, the Clustered {OP} and others. This paper focuses on a comprehensive and thorough survey of recent variants of the {OP}, including the proposed solution approaches. Moreover, the {OP} has been used as a model in many different practical applications. The most recent applications of the {OP}, such as the Tourist Trip Design Problem and the mobile-crowdsourcing problem are discussed. Finally, we also present some promising topics for future research.},

	abstract = {{AbstractThis} article studies the Hazardous Orienteering Problem ({HOP}), a variant of the more famous Orienteering Problem ({OP}). In the {OP}, a vehicle earns a profit for each customer it visits (e.g., to pick up a parcel) subject to an upper bound on the tour time. In the {HOP}, the parcels picked up at some customers have a probability of triggering a catastrophic event. The probability depends on how long the parcels travel on the vehicle. If any catastrophic event triggers, the entire collected profit is lost. The goal is to determine the tour that maximizes the expected profit. The problem has interesting applications in routing of hazardous material, cash-in-transit, and law enforcement. We propose a mixed-integer nonlinear formulation and techniques both to obtain dual bounds and to produce primal solutions. Computational tests investigate the efficacy of the methods proposed and allow to gain insights into solution features.},

Researchers have concentrated particularly on a few properties that seem to be common to many networks: the small-world property, power-law degree distributions, and network transitivity. In this article, we highlight another property that is found in many networks, the property of community structure, in which network nodes are joined together in tightly knit groups, between which there are only looser connections. We propose a method for detecting such communities, built around the idea of using centrality indices to find community boundaries. We test our method on computer-generated and real-world graphs whose community structure is already known and find that the method detects this known structure with high sensitivity and reliability. We also apply the method to two networks whose community structure is not well known—a collaboration network and a food web—and find that it detects significant and informative community divisions in both cases.},
